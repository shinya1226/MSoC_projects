
Intro: Thsi project is Memory_porting_and_ii, basic thought is to help knowing how to mapping array to improve in timing.

Built up: Source the tcl in hls, by vivado_hls -f script.tcl 

Algorithm: Test design is the matrix multiplication, we can set array partition to the input array and set pipeline to the for loop to help the data access and finally improve timing.
